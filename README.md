## Project Choice

Simon

## Project Description

My app is called Simon. This is an online game that allows players to attempt Simon's sequence challenges. Simon will always start off with a short sequence of buttons. Each time the player successfully copies Simon button by button, Simon will then challenge the player with a slightly longer sequence. The player continues playing until the player loses.
